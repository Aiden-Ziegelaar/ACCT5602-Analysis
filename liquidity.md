# Short Term Liquidity Comparison

"Liquidity refers to the ease with which assets can be converted to cash in the 
normal course of business" (2019, P. Hancock, P. Robinson, M. Bazley). There are 
two core factors that go into determining liquidity, current assets and current 
liabilities. The current assets and liabilities of each company can be seen 
depicted in Figure X. 

![Current Assets and Current Liabilities](/Liquidity/CA_CL.png)

As can be seen from the above figure both companies have comparable amounts
of current assets (within AUD 20m), whilst RRL has $58m more current liabilities. 
RRL has increased both its current assets and current liabilities significantly 
in the last year. Whilst PRU has flattened its previous trajectory, posting fairly 
stable results over the last two years.

RRL has seen significant decline in both its current ratio and quick ratio, 
indicating reduced ability to meet short term obligations. This is primarily 
driven by increases in both accounts payable and short-term debt. The effects 
of these two factors has been offset by significant increases in cash assets 
(AUD 54m, FY2019-2021) as well as strong growth in inventory (AUD 105m, FY2019-2021.
PRU has maintained a fairly strong current ratio, however it has noted a decrease 
from last year on its quick ratio. This change has been driven by a decrease cash
and an increase in the value of held inventories. Both companies have seen a large 
increase in held inventories, likely incentivised by a historically high gold 
price. 

Comparing these figures to the median data for companies in the same sector 
(Materials and Mining) with similar total assets (same order of magnitude) we can 
see that PRU more closely matches the wider market, as demonstrated in table X.

|Company   |Quick Ratio |Current Ratio|
|----------|------------|-------------|
|PRU       |1.80 (+0.61)|3.24 (+1.61) |
|RRL       |1.44 (+0.25)|2.33 (-0.7)  |
|Market    |1.19        |1.63         |

As such PRU is better positioned than RRL to meet its short term obligations 
through higher measures of liquidity. However both companies are in a similar
financial position to the wider materials and mining sector. This indicates that 
neither company is at short term risk of not satisfying their obligations.

# Market, Legal or Non-Financial Factors

Both PRU and RRL primarily derive income from gold exploration and ore extraction.
In todays market, especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, gold prices 
have greatly increased, hitting record highs in the past few years 
(2022, gold.org). The fluctuation of the gold price may cause both PRU and RRL to 
examine the efficacy of their current mining operations. In the previous financial 
year PRU and RRL had similar all in sustaining costs (AISC) of AUD $1,368 for PRU 
and AUD $1,373 for RRL. This implies that the pressures that a downwards gold price 
would have on the companies are expected to be similar. Both PRU and RRL engage in
price hedging to offset the impact of a decline on gold prices. RRL's forward 
hedging at the end of 2021 was 320,000 oz at US $1,517 per oz, whilst PRU's forward 
hedging was 300,754 oz at US $1,595. Both companies have similar levels of 
protection in the event of a price decline, however PRU is slightly better 
positioned to deal with a price increase due to lower hedge volume at a 
higher price.

COVID-19 presents an ongoing risk to both companies workforces in the short term 
future. Both PRU and RRL are undertaking business as usual, with heightened 
precautions. PRU has recorded a total of 51 cases across its West African 
operations, whilst RRL has experienced no cases at the time of reporting. PRU and 
RRL acknowledge the operational risks posed by this situation and have lowered 
their confidence in their future gold production forecasts accordingly.
